# Time-tracker
A small project in PHP and SQLlite, to be able to track time spent on a project. 
* Delete function to remove project fomr DB
* Finish to mark to myself that the project is done

And a rainy day I'll sort out the code to connect to DB and build functions instead of right into the code
